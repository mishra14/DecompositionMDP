This project is used to prove the results of the paper -\/ Optimal Control in Markov Decision Processes via Distributed Optimization by Jie Fu, Shuo Han, and Ankit Mishra and Ufuk Topcu ~\newline
This project is a java based tool box that allows formulation of a \hyperlink{classese_1_1seas_1_1upenn_1_1edu_1_1_m_d_p}{M\+D\+P} and creates a decomposition and formulates sparse matrices that are used for solving the \hyperlink{classese_1_1seas_1_1upenn_1_1edu_1_1_m_d_p}{M\+D\+P}.\begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
